# About

This will be the central place for Blanchard lab to store code. Some repositories will be public, some are private

## How to work with it

We are going to have software projects here. What if I want to contribute to an internal project?
 * Make sure you have a personal account at GitHub
 * Get invited to the organization - now you can see internal projects
 * Create issues or comment on existing ones if you have ideas how to improve our code
 * If you want to contribute code, create a fork of a project in your personal space (personal repo). Then do your edits, commit and push to your personal repo, and start a pull request to the organization repo. The pull request will be reviewed and merged by the project admins.

## Code snippets
  We will have a repo (named `gists`?) to share small snippets of code.
